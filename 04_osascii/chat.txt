Write a program in Python to display an ASCII art image of the current Linux distribution in the bash console.

This program uses the platform module to determine the current Linux distribution, and uses an if-elif block to display an ASCII art image corresponding to the detected distribution. In this example, the program recognizes "Ubuntu" and "Fedora" distributions, and display a message if the distribution is not recognized.
You can run this program by running python scriptname.py in the terminal.
Please note that the current ASCII art is just for demonstration purpose only. You can replace it with a more accurate ASCII art for the respective Linux distributions.
