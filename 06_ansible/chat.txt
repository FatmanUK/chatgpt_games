Write an Ansible playbook to install Apache NiFi.

Here is an example Ansible playbook for installing Apache NiFi on a target host:

This playbook does the following:

    Installs the openjdk-8-jdk package, which is a dependency for Apache NiFi,
    Downloads the NiFi binary to the target host,
    Extracts the binary,
    And starts the Apache NiFi service.

Please note that this is just an example, you may need to adjust the paths, versions and commands to match your specific environment.
