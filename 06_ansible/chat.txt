Write an Ansible playbook to install Apache NiFi.

Here is an example Ansible playbook for installing Apache NiFi on a target host:

This playbook does the following:

    Installs the openjdk-8-jdk package, which is a dependency for Apache NiFi,
    Downloads the NiFi binary to the target host,
    Extracts the binary,
    And starts the Apache NiFi service.

Please note that this is just an example, you may need to adjust the paths, versions and commands to match your specific environment.

No, also apply configuration for a three node cluster.

Sure, here is an example playbook that configures a three node Apache NiFi cluster:

This playbook does the following:

    Creates the NiFi conf directory if it does not exist,
    copies the nifi.properties, state-management.xml, authorizers.xml, and users.xml file to conf directory,
    starts the NiFi service.

It is assumed that you have the necessary templates (nifi.properties.j2, state-management.xml.j2, authorizers.xml.j2, and users.xml.j2) in the same directory where you run the playbook.

Also, you need to define the three nodes, ports and a protocol port to communicate between the nodes.

Please note that this is just an example, you may need to adjust the paths, versions and commands to match your specific environment.
